# Igovit (needs update)

> Employees management system

This is a system for registering, updating and viewing of information about available employees and units, with user registration and authentication. Aims to be **simple** and **to the point**, **without overengineering** and **from the scratch**, as a initial MVP, which may later receive other features and improvements.
